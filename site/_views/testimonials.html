          <div>"Our family had the pleasure of working with Everwood Contracting for a complicated stair remodel. We have a custom built home and that brings unique challenges. Garnet came on site, was professional and gave us great feedback on what our options were, taking into account more than just the stairs, how it would impact the existing flooring and handrails. They know there stuff, we were very pleased with the end result. You won't be disappointed with their work or their process. Highly recommend."</div>
