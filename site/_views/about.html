      <div class="line-break"></div>
      <div class="rich-text-container w-richtext">
        <p>Garnet Gaudet is our owner and chief contractor. He has been installing hardwood flooring for&nbsp;over 10 years. Here is the story of how Garnet created Everwood Custom Contracting. </p>
        <p>“From a young age I always wanted to work with wood.”, recalls Garnet. “Growing up on a working farm my parents engrained in us a strong work ethic. As soon as I was allowed, I was helping out on the farm before and after school.” &nbsp;</p>
        <p>“My dad appreciated my love of wood. He contributed greatly to my introduction to hardwood &nbsp;flooring and I started working in wood shops over the summers. I truly value what I learned working alongside those local craftsmen.” </p>
        <p>In high school, he entered an apprenticeship in Fine Woodworking and achieved his Red seal for finish carpentry. </p>
        <p>“After school, I worked for several years in the high-end custom cabinetry and furniture-making business. I was able to fine-tune my love of intricate wood design and learned the importance of&nbsp;attention to detail.” </p>
        <p>“The next several years I spent installing hardwood with local prominent wood flooring companies. At that point, I had over 20 years of woodworking experience and it was time to start my own company.” </p>
        <p>His next step was to speak with his father-in-law Neil (who has over 30 years of woodworking experience) about joining forces and combining our skills and knowledge. “He approved of the idea and that’s how Everwood Custom Contracting was born!”. </p>
        <p>Everwood Custom Contracting is the result of a lifetime love of wood, creating beautiful things, and the guidance of many skilled tradesmen. </p>
