        <p>Q: Is Sand-On-Site finishing messy? </p>
        <p>A: The high-powered vacuums that we use while finishing collects the majority of dust. Prefinished and onsite finishing causes the same amount of disruption. We are very conscious of your home and always try to minimize any mess. </p>
        <p>Q: Can't I just install the floor myself? </p>
        <p>A: You can, but the results will not be the same. We spend time to tight fit, undercut, and scribe where required. This creates the best outcome for every job. Every floor is a reflection of us, which is why we aim to give you the best floor possible. </p>
        <p>Q: Are your products environmentally friendly? </p>
        <p>A: Yes. We offer reclaimed wood flooring that is recycled old barnboard instead of cutting down new trees. You can also inquire about our available low VOC finish options. </p>
        <p>Q: Can you install hardwood in my basement? </p>
        <p>A: Yes. Engineered hardwood flooring is the best option to install. Basements have higher moisture content which can cause wood movement. Engineered flooring is more stable because it has layers of plywood going in different directions as a base under the top hardwood layer. &nbsp;This prevents warping, swelling, and buckling of the boards. If you choose a high-quality product you can still refinish engineered floors in the future. </p>
        <p>Q: Does the humidity of my home affect the hardwood floor? </p>
        <p>A: Yes. If you notice gaps or swelling, the first thing to do is to check the humidity. Wood is a natural material that is affected by its environment. It’s important to maintain proper humidity all year round. </p>
        <p>Q: How should I clean my hardwood floor? </p>
        <p>A: This will depend on the product you have installed, and what finish you use. When we install, we will tell you the optimal way to keep your floor looking new. In general, though, never saturate the floor. Always use a damp cloth and wipe the floor dry. </p>
        <p>Q: I saw an amazing pattern floor on social media. Can you recreate it? </p>
        <p>A: Yes. With the variety of patterns and designs we have available, can recreate what you find online and customize the design for your space. Just save the pictures of your inspiration and show us.</p>
        <p>Q: Do you only install hardwood in houses, or can you do installations in my commercial space too? </p>
        <p>A: Yes. We have installed hardwood flooring in homes and a variety of other spaces including: </p>
        <p>• Restaurants </p>
        <p>• Shopping areas </p>
        <p>• Office spaces </p>
        <p>• Cottages </p>
        <p>• Boathouses </p>
        <p>• Sunrooms </p>
        <p>• Waiting rooms </p>
        <p>• Libraries </p>
        <p>Q: I see you are based out of Orangeville and Dufferin county. I don’t live in that area. Will you come tome? </p>
        <p>A: Yes. We love seeing new places. After over 15 years of hardwood installation, we’ve worked in several locations and would love to add yours to the list! </p>
